      <h3>Reliability</h3>
      <p>
      As a Team Lead at <a href="https://www.badgerinventory.com/">Badger Inventory</a> I leanred what it means to be reliable in a constantly changing environment. Odd hours, unpredictable schedules, driving coworkers long distance through every kind of weather, different stores with different expectations every day, extreme attention to detail, and working fully independently through different store departments and returning reliable numbers in often complex situations.
      </p>
      <h3>Flexibility</h3>
      <p>At Badger, I learned to how to apply my basic understanding of the equipment and workflow to a new environment every day. Every manager at every store had unique demands and expectations.</p>
